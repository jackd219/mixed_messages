Mixed Messages  | Codecademy

# Aims of this project
==

- Create a random generated message each time a user runs program.
- Type of message can be any sort of theme.
- It must contain at least three different types of data.

## How message will be constructed
==

- Message will be logged to the console.
- RNG will look at the indexes of arrays specified to return a result.
- Message will be formatted in string.
- User input will be four different parameters, in order to randomise as much as possible.

## Type of message
==

- My idea is to create several arrays containing several arrays for different scenarios.
- These arrays will be called upon via aforementioned RNG and loops.
- Based on user's input, params will be (age(num), colour of hair(scale 1-3 dark to brightest), and food (any string))
- There should be validations in place to cancel function and start again, using typeof to check for errors.

## The scenarios of the message
==

- First: Using age, this is the beginning of the message, so I want to pre-empt a career that the user might be in. Could be sport if they are young, politics if they are old etc.
- Second: This is random, however the more bright the colour hair, I want the career to be more interesting.
- Third: This is also random, and I plan to be funny with this message. It could be anything.
